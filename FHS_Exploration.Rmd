```{r Time between checkups}
#If you explore the data you see that individuals have the same category multiple times indicated by a blank, 1,2,3, meaning that they had multiple check ups over the years. 

#Let's better understand the average time between these check ups using the age of the participants. 

#Average time between original (baseline) and first checkup
checkup1= FHS$age2-FHS$age1
checkup1sd=sd(checkup1, na.rm=TRUE)
checkup1_mean= mean(na.omit(checkup1))

print(checkup1)

#Average time between checkup 2 and checkup 3
checkup2= FHS$age3-FHS$age2
checkup2sd=sd(checkup2, na.rm=TRUE)
checkup2_mean= mean(na.omit(checkup2))

#On Average you see they are close to 6 years apart with a small standard deviation of .36 - .39 (4-5 months). This confirms that the check ups are relatively normal 
```


```{r Explore log odds mortality at baseline (1956)}
sd<- sapply(FHS,sd)
diabetes <- table(FHS$diabetes1,FHS$death)

rownames(diabetes)<- c("No Diabetes", "Diabetes")
colnames(diabetes)<- c("No Death","Death")
print(diabetes)

#Check Results
sum(FHS$death == 1 & FHS$diabetes1==1, na.rm=TRUE)
sum(FHS$death == 1 & FHS$diabetes1==0, na.rm=TRUE)
sum(FHS$death == 0 & FHS$diabetes1==1, na.rm=TRUE)
sum(FHS$death == 0 & FHS$diabetes1==0, na.rm=TRUE)

```
The estimated log odds of mortality among participants with no diabetes is beta0, which is -0.67 in the fitted model. 

$$\beta0=-0.67$$ 

The estimated log odds of mortality among those who had diabetes in 1956 is equivalent to: 
$$ 
E(death)=\beta_0+\beta_1(diabetes)+\varepsilon_i
\\E(death)=-0.67+1.92(1)
\\E(death)= 1.25
$$

The odds ratio for the association between diabetes in 1956 and mortality, comparing those with diabetes to those without diabetes
```{r Odds Ratio}
or_diabetes<- oddsratio.wald(diabetes)
print(or_diabetes)
or_data<-(or_diabetes$data)
or_measure<-(or_diabetes$measure)
or_p<-(or_diabetes$p.value)
suppressWarnings(stargazer(or_data,type="text"))
suppressWarnings(stargazer(or_measure,type="text"))

```
The estimate of the odds ratio for the association between diabetes and mortality from the 2x2 is 6.83 and can also be describes as:

The odds ratio for the association between diabetes in 1956 and mortality is 
$$ e^{\beta1} = 6.83$$ 

The odds ratio of 6.83 indicates that those with diabetes have more than 6 times the odds of dying over the 24-year follow-up period compared to those without diabetes.

Conduct Hypothesis test to examine the coefficient of diabetes is significant. We will complete the Wald test which is the same as:
$$ \frac{\beta^1}{{SE}(\beta^1)} $$ 

```{r Wald Test}
summary(logit_diabetes)
z<-coef(summary(logit_diabetes))[,"z value"]
suppressWarnings(stargazer(z,type="text"))

```
Hypothesis test to compare the fit of the model with and without diabetes.This would be a likelihood ratio test. 95.10 is the test statistic from the likelihood ratio test comparing the fit of the model with and without diabetes.

```{r Likelihood Ratio Test}
llr<-loglm(~death + diabetes1,xtabs(~death + diabetes1,data = FHS))
suppressWarnings(stargazer(llr$lrt,type="text", title = "Likelihood Ratio Test"))

```


The Wald test statistic for the coefficient of diabetes is 8.71. The p values from the Wald test and the Likelihood Ratio Test are both less than 0.05, indicating that there is a significant association between diabetes and mortality. In addition, the odds ratio of 6.83 indicates that those with diabetes have more than 6 times the odds of dying over the 24-year follow-up period compared to those without diabetes.

The estimate of the risk ratio for the association between diabetes and mortality from the 2x2 table
```{r Risk Ratio}
rr<-riskratio.wald(diabetes)
rr_measure<-rr$measure
rr<-rr_measure[2,1]

suppressWarnings(stargazer(rr,type="text", title = "Risk Ratio"))

```
Since the Risk of Mortality in the study is high (approximately 0.35 or 35% among all participants), the odds and the risk are different from each other, and the odds ratio is more extreme (i.e., further from 1.0) than the risk ratio.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
